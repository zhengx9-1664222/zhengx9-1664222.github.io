    <h1> Interving Human </h1>
    <font face="Times New Roman"> The goal of interviewing users is to learn about everything <br> that might infuence how the users might use what you are creating. <br> Good interviewing is a skill you develop with practice. <br> The great myth is that you need to be a good talker. <br> Conducting a good interview is actually about shutting up. <br>This can be very hard, especially when you are enthusiastic about the topic. </font> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <font face="Impact"> Remember, the people you are interviewing want to be liked. <br>They want to demonstrate their smarts. <br>When you are interviewing someone you know nothing. <br> You are learning a completely new and fascinating subject: that person.</font>
